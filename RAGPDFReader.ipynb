Introduction \\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are all important technologies in the ﬁeld of robotics \\n[1] . The term artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) describes a machine’s capacity to carry out operations that ordinarily require human intel- \\nlect, such as speech recognition, understanding of natural language, and decision-making. Robots can detect and interact with their \\nsurroundings, make judgments, and carry out diﬃcult tasks with the aid of AI. [2] . A branch of AI known as \"machine learning\" uses \\nalgorithms to give robots the ability to learn from data and get better over time [3] . It’s possible to program robots to carry out certain \\njobs in robotics, such as grasping, object identiﬁcation, and path planning. Artiﬁcial neural networks are used in deep learning, a \\n∗ Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: Mohsen.soori@kyrenia.edu.tr (M.

DL has been particularly useful in robotics \\nfor tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and object detection. Together, these technologies have \\nenabled the development of robots that can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple pick-and-place operations to complex manip- \\nulation and navigation in unstructured environments [5] . The application of AI, ML, and DL in robotics has the potential to transform \\nthe ﬁeld, enabling robots to become more intelligent, autonomous, and eﬀective in a wide range of applications. Robotics is a rapidly \\nevolving ﬁeld, and the use of AI, ML, and DL is likely to continue to play a key role in shaping the future of robotics [6] . \\nIn advanced robotic systems, AI is used to create robots that can perceive, reason, and act autonomously in complex environments. \\nMachine Learning is used to enable robots to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. Deep Learning \\nis used to solve speciﬁc problems that are diﬃcult to solve with traditional Machine Learning techniques, such as image and speech \\nrecognition. By combining these technologies, advanced robotics systems can be designed to perform complex tasks that were once \\nthought impossible. The relationship between them are inclusive in terms of analysis and modiﬁcation of advanced robotic systems. \\nThese are just a few examples of how AI, ML, and DL are used in robotics. Here are some examples of how they are used in diﬀerent \\nrobotic systems as, \\n1. Object Detection and Recognition: Object detection and recognition are critical tasks in robotics that have become possible thanks \\nto deep learning. By training neural networks with massive amounts of labeled data, robots can identify and classify objects in \\ntheir environment with high accuracy [7] . \\n2. Predictive Maintenance: Predictive maintenance is a maintenance approach that uses AI and ML to detect potential issues before \\nthey occur. By analyzing data from sensors and other sources, predictive maintenance algorithms can predict when a robot’s \\ncomponents may fail, allowing for proactive repairs or replacements [8] . \\n3. Gesture and Speech Recognition: Gesture and speech recognition are also important applications of AI and ML in robotics. For \\nexample, robots like Pepper can recognize and respond to human gestures and speech, making them useful in a variety of contexts \\nsuch as customer service or healthcare [9] . \\n4. Robotic Surgery: Robotic surgery is a ﬁeld where AI and ML are revolutionizing the way operations are performed. By using \\nadvanced algorithms, robotic surgeons can assist human surgeons during complex procedures, reducing the risk of complications \\nand improving outcomes. Surgical robots use AI, ML, and DL to aid surgeons in performing complex operations with greater \\nprecision and accuracy [10] . \\n5. Medical applications: DL techniques are particularly useful in analyzing medical images due to their ability to recognize patterns \\nand features that are not easily identiﬁable by humans [11] . This can help doctors to identify subtle changes in the images that \\nmay indicate the presence of disease [12] . Machine learning models used in drug delivery for infectious disease treatment is shown \\nin the Fig. 1 [13] . Ensemble algorithm, decision trees and random forest, instance based algorithms and artiﬁcial neural network \\nare used to enhance drug delivery of infectious diseases. \\n6. Military robotics: Robotics is used in military operations for tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and bomb disposal. AI and \\nML algorithms are used to analyze data and make decisions based on the information gathered [14] . \\n7. Agriculture: AI and ML are being used to develop robots that can autonomously navigate and manage crops, increasing eﬃciency \\nand reducing labor costs. Robotics is used to automate tasks in agriculture, such as planting, harvesting, and spraying. AI and \\nML algorithms are used to optimize the farming operations, such as predicting weather patterns, optimizing water usage, and \\nmonitoring crop health [15] . \\n8 Service robotics: Robotics is used to provide services to humans, such as cleaning, food delivery, and customer service. AI and ML \\nalgorithms are used to enable robots to interact with humans and understand their needs and preferences [16] . \\n9 Autonomous driving: AI and ML are used to help cars navigate roads and make driving decisions on their own. For example, \\nself-driving cars use computer vision to detect and recognize objects on the road, and ML algorithms to learn and adapt to \\nnew situations and road conditions [17] . For instance, robots like self-driving cars use AI to detect obstacles and predict traﬃc \\nmovements. Meanwhile, ML algorithms use data from sensors, cameras, and GPS to make navigation decisions [18] . \\n10. Robotics manufacturing: Robotics is used to automate tasks in manufacturing plants, such as assembly line tasks, painting, and \\nwelding. AI and ML algorithms are used to optimize the robotic operations, such as improving the eﬃciency and accuracy of \\nmovements [2] . \\nThere are various applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) in analysis and \\nmodiﬁcation of advanced robotics. Some of the performance data of these methods in advanced robotics are discussed below: \\n1. Object Recognition: Object recognition is a crucial task in robotics, and it is essential for autonomous navigation and manipulation. \\nDeep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved impressive results in object recognition. \\n2. Motion Planning: Motion planning is a key task in robotics that involves ﬁnding a collision-free path for a robot to move from one \\npoint to another. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning technique that has been used to achieve impressive \\nresults in motion planning. For example, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm has been used to generate \\nsmooth and eﬃcient paths for robotic manipulators. \\n3. Control: Control is another important task in robotics, and it involves regulating the movement of robots. Deep Reinforcement \\nLearning (DRL) has been used to achieve impressive results in control tasks. For example, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \\nalgorithm has been used to train a robotic arm to grasp and move objects. \\n4. Localization: Localization is the process of determining the position of a robot in its environment. Machine Learning techniques \\nsuch as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests have been used to achieve impressive results in localization tasks. \\nFor example, a Random Forest-based method achieved an accuracy of 98.8% in a robot localization task. \\n55 '),\n",

Drug delivery using machine learning algorithms is utilized to treat infectious diseases [13] . \\n5. Object Detection: Object detection is the process of detecting and localizing objects in an image. Deep Learning techniques such \\nas Faster R-CNN and YOLO have achieved impressive results in object detection tasks. \\nAI in robotics can be used to enable robots to recognize objects, navigate complex environments, and even make decisions based \\non real-time data. ML can be used to teach robots to learn from experience and adapt to changing situations.

Taxi services \\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are all technologies that have the potential to revolu- \\ntionize the ﬁeld of robotics taxi services. These technologies can help improve the safety, eﬃciency, and overall customer experience \\nof autonomous taxi services [123] . AI is the overarching technology that enables machines to perform tasks that would normally \\nrequire human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on \\ntraining machines to improve their performance on speciﬁc tasks by providing them with data and algorithms [124] . Deep learning \\nis a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to analyze large amounts of data and learn patterns [125] . \\nIn the context of robotics taxi services, AI, ML, and DL can be used to achieve several goals. For example: \\n1. Perception: Autonomous vehicles need to be able to perceive their environment accurately to navigate safely.

AI and DL techniques can be used to develop decision-making algorithms that take into account a wide range of factors, \\nsuch as weather, road conditions, and passenger preferences [128] . \\n4. Route optimization: DL can be used to analyze traﬃc patterns and optimize routes for taxi drivers. This can help them avoid \\ncongestion and take the most eﬃcient route to their destination, which can save time and reduce fuel costs [129] . \\n5. Customer experience: AI and DL can be used to personalize the customer experience by analyzing data on passenger preferences \\nand behavior, and providing recommendations for entertainment, food, and other services [130] . \\n6.

This can help taxi companies maintain high safety standards and reduce the risk of accidents [132] . \\n9. Autonomous driving: DL is used in autonomous driving technology, which is being developed by taxi companies to reduce labor \\ncosts and improve safety. Autonomous taxis can provide a consistent level of service without the need for drivers [133] . \\n10. Personalization: ML algorithms can analyze customer data to personalize their experience. For example, by analyzing past trips, \\nAI can suggest preferred routes or destinations to customers, reducing their travel time and improving their overall experience \\n[134] . \\n11. Predictive analytics: AI and ML can be used to analyze historical data to predict future demand for taxi services. This can help taxi \\ncompanies optimize their ﬂeet management, scheduling, and pricing strategies to ensure that they are providing the right number \\nof taxis in the right areas at the right times [135] . Intelligent cab service system using the AI based on predictive analytics to \\nselect the best cab for the demand and desire of customers and taxi service company is shown in the Fig. 10 [136] . The wireless \\ncommunication network can be used to provide an advanced distributed approach in Cab booking system in order to enhance \\neﬃciency of intelligent cab service system. \\nOverall, the combination of AI, ML, and DL has the potential to make robotics taxi services safer, more eﬃcient, and more enjoyable \\nfor passengers. AI, ML, and DL are transforming the taxi industry by improving eﬃciency, reducing costs, and enhancing customer \\nexperience. \\n6.
